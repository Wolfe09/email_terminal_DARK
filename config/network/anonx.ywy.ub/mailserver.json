        "body": "Home Safety inspector hospitalized for a 'severe allergic reaction' to bee stings. After owners noticed 'Honey' leaking from the home’s light fixtures, inspector Hal Lewis, 54, removed the fixtures to discover the attic loft of newly purchased 1930s home contaminated by a massive bee’s nest. Renovations have been put on hold pending Environmental Review and Relocation.  Officially you’re investigating under the auspices of the EPA to relocate the aforementioned bee’s nest. Unofficially, there are no bees. Witnesses describe a honeycomb-like-structure in the loft after removing a light fixture leaking a sweet smelling slime. After the victim took a crowbar to it, he was exposed to the slime which caused a piercing injury and injected an unknown biotoxin. The medical report says bee-sting. Exposure caused paralysis and shock. The victim may lose the arm. This all points to a possible Unnatural Contamination.  Your assignment. Collect samples, make an analysis and get out. There's a Green Box located at a nearby RentaCube. In cube 87 there's some gear there including standard biohazard protection, cleaning, and collection. I want to study this. Demolition, termination is not operable. Do not to Cross the Border on this one, capiche? As always, maintain anonymity, conceal the nature of the opera and keep the public safe from and ignorant of the threat.    TITUS"
